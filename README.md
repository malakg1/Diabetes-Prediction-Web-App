# Diabetes-Prediction-Web-App

## Overview:
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data. The model is deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input their health information and receive real-time predictions.

## Key Features:
### Data Visualization: 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations include distplots, box plots, and heatmaps to analyze the distribution, outliers, and correlations among features.

### Machine Learning Model: 
Various machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated to predict diabetes. The Random Forest classifier is selected as the best-performing model based on accuracy.

### Web Application Deployment:
The trained model is integrated into a Flask web application. Users can input their age, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, gender, smoking history, hypertension, and heart disease status to get predictions on diabetes risk.

### Interactive Dashboards:
Dash and Plotly are utilized to create interactive visualizations, allowing users to explore relationships between different health conditions and diabetes.
